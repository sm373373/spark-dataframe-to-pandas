# Spark DataFrame to Pandas Converter

## Overview

This Visual Studio Code extension helps developers working with PySpark DataFrames to easily convert them to Pandas DataFrames during debugging sessions. With this extension, you can right-click a PySpark DataFrame in the Locals pane and instantly convert it to a Pandas DataFrame for easier inspection and manipulation. The newly converted Pandas DataFrame can also be viewed using the VSCode Data Viewer (with the Data Wrangler extension).

## Features

- **Convert Spark DataFrame to Pandas DataFrame**: Simply right-click on any PySpark DataFrame in the debugger and select "Convert Spark DataFrame to Pandas".
- **Automatic Variable Creation**: A new variable is created for the Pandas DataFrame, so it can be accessed and explored during your debug session.
- **View Pandas DataFrame in Data Viewer**: After conversion, you can inspect the Pandas DataFrame using the VSCode Data Wrangler extension.

## How It Works

1. During a debug session, pause the execution where a PySpark DataFrame is present.
2. In the Debuggerâ€™s Variables window, right-click on the Spark DataFrame you want to convert.
3. Select the option `Convert Spark DataFrame to Pandas` from the context menu.
4. The extension converts the Spark DataFrame and assigns it to a new variable with the suffix `_pandas`.
5. Optionally, you can view the DataFrame using the Data Wrangler's `Data Viewer`.

## Installation

1. Install the extension via VSCode by building and packaging it:
    ```bash
    vsce package
    ```
2. Open the `VSIX` file generated and install it in your VSCode environment.
3. Install the Data Wrangler extension if you want to use the `View in Data Viewer` feature.

## Requirements

- **VSCode**: Ensure you have Visual Studio Code installed.
- **VSCode Debugger**: A working debugger setup in VSCode for your PySpark projects.
- **Data Wrangler**: For viewing DataFrames, install the Data Wrangler extension to enable the Data Viewer feature.

## Extension Settings

This extension currently doesn't require any configuration settings.

## Usage

1. Start a debug session in VSCode with a PySpark script.
2. Pause the execution at a breakpoint where a Spark DataFrame is present.
3. Right-click the DataFrame in the Locals window.
4. Select `Convert Spark DataFrame to Pandas`.
5. The converted DataFrame will appear in the Locals window with a `_pandas` suffix.
6. Right-click the new variable and choose `View Value in Data Viewer` to inspect it (requires Data Wrangler).

## Contributing

Feel free to open issues and submit pull requests if you have suggestions for improvements or new features.

## Known Issues

- Refreshing the variables window may take a few moments after converting the DataFrame. In some cases, manually stepping in the debugger might help update the view.
- The `View in Data Viewer` feature requires the Data Wrangler extension to be installed.
